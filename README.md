The real motivation behind this script was the lack of a drawing pad (like the ones from wacomm) and a descent urge to try digital designing.I made a script that could replicate the functioning of a Graphics Tablet while there's a vast improvement required and a long way to go before it could stand if not at par than to the best of it's ability. The performance is dependent upon the Processor's ability to input commands from terminal and simulate the inputs. Use of inputs.h is done to collect the real time x-y location of cursor on touchpad, along with pressure, type of touch, etc. While '' library from Linux is used to make inputs like single click, right, left, double click and it's repetition 'n' no. of times. The result is that our fingers were able to be used as an input which is absolute, not relative of previous position on touchpad (Just like a pencil/pen on paper, which initiates and proceeds drawing from the point of contact on the writing material). The refinement of code, like removing uncommon exceptions has made it run more efficiently. But, a major requirement is to install '' library using sudo apt-get install ''. I hope this small try of mine adds up to some purpose.

## NOTICE : HAVE UNFORTUNATELY LOST THE ORIGINAL WORK i.e. THE WHOLE SCRIPT IN A STUPID FORMATTING OF HARD DRIVE, WILL DEFINITELY UPLOAD HERE IF I'M ABLE TO RESTORE.
